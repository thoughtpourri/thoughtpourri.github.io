										<h3>Why <b>thoughtpourri</b>.</h3>
										<blockquote><b>thoughtpourri</b>s carry the nostalgia of typewritten letters and add a vintage touch to your words.<br />
										With personalised illustrations of various styles you can choose from, we make sure that no two <b>thoughtpourri</b>s are ever alike.<br />
										Let someone know how much they mean to you. Instead of picking up a gift off the shelf, send them a one-of-a-kind <b>thoughtpourri</b>!</blockquote>

										<h3>What can be a <b>thoughtpourri</b>?</h3>
										<blockquote>At the moment, we accept messages in the form of letters. <b>thoughtpourri</b>s are crafted such that your letter fits on one side of an A4 page, so make sure it fits otherwise we'd have to use another sheet and that'd create incontinuity. It's completely fine if you exceed a sheet, but just so you know :)</blockquote>

										<h3>How long will my <b>thoughtpourri</b> take?</h3>
										<blockquote>Each illustration on a <b>thoughtpourri</b>, right from conceptualisation to final touches, is made in a unique and personalised way. So, one <b>thoughtpourri</b> will take at least 7 days to make, so place your order a week or two in advance. We request you to oblige if we have a lot of <b>thoughtpourri</b>s on buffer. Every <b>thoughtpourri</b> is crafted with the same love. One love.</blockquote>

										<h3>How do I place an order?</h3>
										<blockquote>We've tried our best to make sure ordering a <b>thoughtpourri</b> is so simple, that it's hard for us to explain. However, just <a href="https://m.me/thoughtpourri" target="_blank"><b>say hi</b></a> to us on Messenger and our good pal, mr. thoughtbot will guide you through the journey!<br />
										The price of a <b>thoughtpourri.</b> is <b>â‚¹200</b> and our payments are securely handled by <a href="https://gum.co/thoughtpourri" target="_blank">Gumroad</a>. We are partnering with <a href="https://www.opinioapp.com/" target="_blank">Opinio</a> to handle the deliveries, so even if you don't stay in Bangalore we probably got you covered. Any further queries? Reach out to us below.</blockquote>

										<h3>I'm just curious; who types out our letters?</h3>
										<blockquote><b>DISCLAIMER</b>: We don't intend to poke our nose into your business and we'll never let you down. We swear by it.<br />
										Coming to the question, tbh it's kinda embarrasing cause we find it extremely sophisticated to use a typewriter like a pro, so we went with the pros themselves. See our future plans written below.</blockquote>

										<h3>I'm an <b>artist/illustrator</b>! Can I be of any help?</h3>
										<blockquote>As our chief designer likes to say; <b>"Paaylaagu!" (*fall at your feet*)</b><br />
										Feel free to apply <a href="https://thoughtpourri.com/apply" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>, and do showcase some of your work! We'll get back to you ASAP!</blockquote>

										<h3>What's the future for <b>thoughtpourri</b>?</h3>
										<blockquote>We did start out as a fun project to keep ourselves occupied for the summer of '16 but we're definitely not gonna stop there. We plan on expanding into postcards and more other personalised goodies that combine the best of both our worlds, classy and artistic.<br />
										On a more serious note, we're trying to build <b>thoughtpourri.</b> into a social brand by giving jobs to the typists who are depleting in number due to the advancements in technology and giving more opportunities to artists and designers and build a community that'll make <b>thoughtpourri.</b> an on-demand service, anywhere. <b>Magizchi!</b></blockquote>

										<h3>How do I contact you guys in case of any queries or issues?</h3>
										<blockquote>Our team is highly proactive and approachable. Just <a href="https://m.me/thoughtpourri" target="_blank"><b>drop a message</b></a> on Facebook or do it the old school way and shoot us a mail at <a href="mailto:thoughtpourri@ohme.ga" target="_blank"><b>thoughtpourri@ohme.ga</b></a> and will get back to you within no time!</blockquote>

										<h3>Bro! How did you make the website da?</h3>
										<blockquote>Our website is based on the good deeds of the folks at <a href="https://pixelarity.com/?ref=8586576884" target="_blank">Pixelarity</a> and <a href="http://html5up.net" target="_blank">HTML5UP</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ajlkn" target="_blank">AJ</a> and a lil bit of tweaking knowledge on HTML5 and CSS3.</blockquote>
